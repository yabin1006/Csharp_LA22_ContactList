# Learning Activity 22: Contact List 
Write a program that stores your phone’s contact list. A contact has a name and a phone 
number (10 digits). The user should be able to type “add <Name> <Number>” to add a new 
contact with a given phone number, or to update an existing contact by adding a phone 
number “update <Old Number> <Updated Name> <New Number>”. If a user has more than 
one phone number, they will use the add command multiple times. A user can delete a contact 
by using the command “delete <Number>”. Finally, the user should also be able to type “find
<Name>” to get a list of that contact’s phone numbers. The program should keep running until 
the user types the command: exit
